## Installation and usage.

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. You need to ensure that you have `pipenv`
installed on your system.

Here's how to install the dependencies, and get started.

- Install it using **`pipenv sync -d`**
- Once done, spawn a shell to run the files: `pipenv shell`

And you're done, and you can run any of the files, and test them.

### Project structure

This project has 3 main sections.

- `src/` Contains the python scripts for training the ML Models.
- `notebooks/` contains the jupyter notebooks with explanations and the outputs of our end
  goal.
- `models/` contains the exported model to make your work easy.
