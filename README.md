# Anime face generation using DCGAN

> An interesting and special GAN method consisting of convolutional layers to generate pixel perfect anime images.

## Installation and usage.

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. You need to ensure that you have `pipenv`
installed on your system.

Here's how to install the dependencies, and get started.

- Install it using **`pipenv sync -d`**
- Once done, spawn a shell to run the files: `pipenv shell`

And you're done, and you can run any of the files, and test them.
